The file is the introduction for the fine-grained remote sensing classificaiton datasets.

### FGSC-23
Fine-grained ship classification dataset\cite{fgsc23}, FGSC-23 for short, is a high-resolution optical fine-grained remote sensing image classification dataset, including 23 types of ships and 4052 samples. Each target is given a class label, an aspect ratio label, and a distribution direction label. Compared with the existing optical remote sensing image ship target recognition dataset, the FGSC-23 dataset has the characteristics of diverse image scenes, fine classification and complete labels.
