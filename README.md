The file is the introduction for the fine-grained remote sensing classificaiton datasets.

### FGSC-23
#### Introduction
Fine-grained ship classification dataset\cite{fgsc23}, FGSC-23 for short, is a high-resolution optical fine-grained remote sensing image classification dataset, including 23 types of ships and 4052 samples. Each target is given a class label, an aspect ratio label, and a distribution direction label. Compared with the existing optical remote sensing image ship target recognition dataset, the FGSC-23 dataset has the characteristics of diverse image scenes, fine classification and complete labels.

### FGSCR-42

#### Introduction
Fine-Grained Ship Classification in Remote-sensing with 42 classes, FGSCR-42 for short, contains 42 subclasses of 10 broad classes, specifically, subclasses of ships such as Kitty-Hawk class aircraft carrier, Arleigh-Burke class destroyer, and mega-yacht. The images of this dataset are composed of sliced images of the object detection datasets DOTA, HRSC2016, NWPUVHR-10, etc. The slices are obtained by extending the data in the target frame label attached to these datasets to the surrounding by a certain pixel and then cutting them out from the original image. Compared with FGSC-23, the dataset category is further subdivided, specific to the type or class of the ship.
